# Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based music recommendation system that suggests music tracks based on the user's detected emotions from their facial expressions. It combines computer vision techniques using OpenCV for emotion detection and deep learning using TensorFlow for music recommendations.

## Features
- Emotion detection from facial expressions using OpenCV and pre-trained deep learning models.
- Integration with Spotify or other music services to fetch music recommendations.
- Personalized music recommendations based on the detected emotion.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Spotify API (or the API of your chosen music service)
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
